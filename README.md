# Invenio Troubleshooting

**TL;DR:**:
- [Search existing questions](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/troubleshooting/issues)
- [Ask a question](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/troubleshooting/issues/new)

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a troubleshooting knowledge base
for Invenio, helping the community to better communicate and avoiding that the 
same problem is rediscovered and solved multiple times by different developers. 

We use the GitHub issues much like a forum to either ask questions or post solutions 
to general problems encountered with Invenio.

Trial period: We run this during a trial period of 2 months to see if it gains traction
in the community.

### Is my problem already solved?

1. [Invenio documentation](https://invenio.readthedocs.io): Check if the
   documentation may already have an answer to your question. For developers,
   note that each individual Invenio module usually has separate usage and API
   reference documentation.

### What can I ask here?

* Bug reports should normally go to the specific repository. If you don't know
  where, then open an issue here and we will help you where it should be
  reported.

### Repeated questions

If you are answering the same question more than twice on the Gitter channel,
then put your answer on this knowledge base or write up documentation for it
depending on the nature.
